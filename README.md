# Dark And Darker SkullBuddy

## Description
SkullBuddy is an automation tool to quickly list loot on the marketplace in Dark and Darker.

SkullBuddy utilizes the PyAutoGUI library for game navigation.

SkullBuddy ONLY interacts with gameplay outside of the dungeon
and does not allow the user to hack, cheat, abuse, manipulate, 
change or otherwise obtain unauthorised access to any benefits or features in-game 
and does not automate gameplay mechanisms, only menu navigation.
